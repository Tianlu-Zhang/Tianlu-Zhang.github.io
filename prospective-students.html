	<br><br>
	

	<HR>
	For <b>PhD</b> students:

	<br><br>

	<font >
		I usually look for one PhD student each year (starting in Spring or Fall) to work on challenging problems in computer and robotic vision. In particular, the student will work on intelligent video analysis, 
		and the topics include but are not limited to visual tracking, vision-language video understanding, visual localization, segmentation, etc. The ultimate goal of my research is to equip the machine/computer with the ability to 
		understand objects in the video. If you'd like to know my research work, please refer to my publications at <a href="https://hengfan2010.github.io/publications.html" target="_blank"><font color="#2D61FF">this page</font></a>.
		<br><br>
		
		Qualified PhD students should be highly self-motivated with relevant research experience in computer vision or related fields. A MS degree in CS or related areas is required. Solid background in mathematics and strong programming ability in C++/Python are desired. The students 
		must be familiar with deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). All qualified students will be financially supported with research or teaching assistantship.

		<br><br>
		If you are interested, please send your full CV, transcript(s), and test scores to my e-mail (heng.fan@unt.edu). The subject can be: Prospective PhD applicant for [semester] (semester can be Spring or Fall with a specific year)

	<HR>
	For <b>master</b> students:

	<br><br>

	<font >
		I am always recruiting master students to conduct research with me. Students are requested to have significant prior experiences related to computer vision and machine learning, e.g., taking relevant courses before. Usually, research 
		and teaching assistantship will not be provided to master students, but qualified students will be recommended to be an instruction assistant (IA) in the department.

		<br><br>
		If you are interested, please send me a CV and we can talk for more details.
